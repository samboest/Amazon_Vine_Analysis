 ## Summary
For the Toys GL, there appears to be no bias for the vine program.  This seems perplexing, but I work at amazon and it makes sense to me. Vine reviews are a great tool for showcasing new or technical products (think a robotic lawnmower).  That product probably has to be assembled, configured and tested by any customer.  Having a expert review that products is really helpful, because it helps customers who may not be engineers make an informed decision.  

There are really no experts in toys.  Toys also have a high amount of brand awarness and external marketing that is not on amazon's website. For that reason, it is very difficult to sell vine credits to vendors such as hasboro, matel, etc. The value is not really there for them.  For example "Baby-Shark" toys, dont really need reviews to sell.  You can see this from the amount of reviews, that are not vine and their higher number of 5 star ratings.  Laslty, if this analysis was run on the camera or pc GLs, the results would probably show that vine is beneficial.  Once again, vine is usually really good for tech/spec heavy product types... not plushies.
